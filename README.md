# The Unity Toolkit
A collection of common video game features, implemented in C# for Unity. The goal is to make a collection of tools that are easy-to-use, customizable, and lightweight.

## Not-even-an-alpha disclaimer
The Unity Toolkit is currently still in development. If you find parts of it that are already useful (such as the dialogue editor), feel free to use it or make PRs for improvements! However, be aware that everything is still subject to change without warning until the project is much further along in the development process.
